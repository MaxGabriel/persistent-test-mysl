persistent-test-mysl
====================

In order to test HEAD of persistent-mysql, I used `cabal sandbox add-source path/to/latest/persistent/mysql`, changed the version of my local persistent-mysql to 1.3.0.29 (just to visually differentiate it from the currently released 1.3.0.2), and cabal installed.
